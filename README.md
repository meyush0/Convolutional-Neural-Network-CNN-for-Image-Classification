# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify images into one of the ten classes present in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## About the CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 32x32 pixel image with RGB color channels.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
