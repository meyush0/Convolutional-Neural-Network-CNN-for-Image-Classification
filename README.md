# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Image-Classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify images into one of the ten classes present in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
